# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

Here is my project related to Twitter sentiment analysis, based on the NLTK Twitter dataset.

1. I have covered the following topics:

  * Introduction with library import and simple visualization
  * Preprocess raw text for Sentiment analysis
  * Remove hyperlinks, Twitter marks and styles
  * Tokenize the string, remove stop words and punctuations
  * Stemming

2. Then I build and visualized word frequencies. For this, a dictionary was needed, to be specific:
  * It's definition
  * Testing the addition or editing of entries
  * Accessing values and lookup keys

After that, I've created table of word counts and then visualized it.

3. Finally, I visualized tweets and the pretrained Logistic Regression model
  * I loaded the extracted features
  * The pretrained Logistic Regression model
  * Plotted the samples in a scatter plot
  * Plotted the model alongside the data
